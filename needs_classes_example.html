		<h3>The Scope of History</h3>
		<p>Historians currently think that anatomically modern humans have been around for between 200,000 and 300,000 of the planetâ€™s 4.5 billion years. And even though 200,000 years is less than one 20,000th of the history of the planet, it is still a very long time!</p>

		<p>For context, 200,000 years would represent at least 6,000 generations of your ancestors (your grandparents are only 2 generations from you). 200,000 years is also nearly 1,000 times as long as the United States has been a country. It is 100 times as distant in the past as the time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" target="_blank">Jesus</a> and the Roman Empire. It's also 40 times as distant in the past as the earliest written records we have found.</p>

		<p>Think about the scope of what must have happened during that time: adventures, sorrows, environmental change, and the rise and fall of civilizations. As historians, we have the privilege of exploring this vast expanse of human experience.</p>

		<h3>Written Records</h3>
		<p>Our main tool as historians is what has been written by those who came before us. In fact, this is what formally defines history and sometimes sets it apart from archaeology and anthropology. For example, the oldest written records archaeologists have discovered in Egypt are from over 5,000 years ago; the date when they were created is the currently accepted date at which formal history (as opposed to "prehistory") begins in that part of the world. Of course, we might one day find older records!</p>
